# boardgame-geeks-search-tool

Executive Summary
This section provides an overview to the project. It should briefly touch on the motivation, data question, data to be used, along with any known assumptions and challenges.
I played about 50-60 board games so far and found out that there are 100000+ boardgame registered in boardgame geeks data. I wanted to explore deeper into boardgames with this capstone projects.
Fortunately, I found the data which is mined a year ago from boardgame geeks. It would be interesting to compare game data from July 2020 and July 2021. And Boardgame geeks website allows data mining using API so I plan to do data mining from website and compare the data from July 2020.
So In this caption, using data from the website I plan to make a csv file contains the statistics of the data mined in July and search tool that people can search for the board game they want to play next.
Boardgame geeks is the biggest boardgame website and I believe it would be good project to increase my skills on getting the data and creating the tool.


Motivation
Here you will go into more detail about why you have chosen this project.
It’s been a year since I joined board game night with my friends and I started really like it. The world of boardgame is so much bigger than I thought and new games keep releasing every week. I wanted to combine this capstone project with my personal interest and dive deeper into boardgame data.

Data Question
Present your question. Feel free to include any research/articles that are relevant or show where others have attempted to answer this question.

1. get the 2021 data of game rank in boardgame geeks website

2.get statistics in average playtime, average player number, difficulty, most owned game and most wished game. Try to see if there’s any trend in these variables and relation to game rank.

3.find the game artist who published the most boardgame and the game artist with most high average ratings

4. fine the game publisher who published the most boardgame and publisher with the most high average ratings

5. compare the game rank from July 2020 and July 2021. What is the most popular game genre in each data?

6. How many new games registered in the website?



Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
